# BetterEndForge

Fork of BetterEnd (Forge)
Hoping to Fix Magnesium Compatibility and Implement missing features.


~~If you're looking for progress updates. Look at the serewrite branch.
Do not expect this soon, as I currently have to completely rewrite the mod, as the way Beethoven ported it, makes it too hard to keep up with the original and add new content.
I also have to migrate it back from BCLib, as it currently isn't ported.~~
In the time it took me to write this out, I decided against a rewrite, as the implementation of Paulev's BCLib makes this a bigger task than I would like to take on.
As such, I will remain with Beethoven's Build.

If you would like to help, please contribute to my new issue on currently Missing Features so I can get to implementing them.
